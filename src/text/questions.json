But local people do not have any say in the redevelopment and are forced to leave.\nIf you took a walk around Western District just a couple of years ago, you would see mostly stationery shops, bakeries, grocers and university students eating in cha chaan tengs. For years, even with its proximity to Central,the old neighbourhood remained largely untouched, retaining its traditional characteristics and flavour.\nBut when three new MTR stations -- Sai Ying Pun, HKU and Kennedy Town -- opened in the area in late2014, they brought with them a whole range of bars and expensive restaurants that drew in young rich hipsters. Today, Western District is the new, trendy neighbourhood, with young professionals increasingly turning older buildings into expensive trendy flats, forcing many long-term residents to leave the area that has been their home all their lives.\nTraditional shops are forced to leave because of high rents: 250 of the 700 shops in the Sai Ying Pun area either changed tenants or closed down from 2015 to 2017.\nThere have been multiple complaints from residents about noise from bars and restaurants. \"For families and the elderly in this area, they are disturbed by the noise every day and can't afford to shop,\" one netizen said. \"We can't stop the world from developing, but there has to be a balance.\"\nYour class is discussing the redevelopment of older districts in Hong Kong. Your group has been asked to discuss the problems redevelopment causes. You may want to talk about:",
